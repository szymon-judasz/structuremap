# StructureMap has been [sunsetted](https://jeremydmiller.com/2018/01/29/sunsetting-structuremap/) 
  
See instead the newer [Lamar](https://github.com/jasperfx/lamar) library as a replacement for StructureMap in new applications. I will continue to accept pull requests and try to answer questions, but there will be no new development on StructureMap unless someone else takes over project ownership.

Welcome to StructureMap, the oldest Inversion of Control container for .Net. 

Getting StructureMap
--------------------

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/structuremap/structuremap](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/structuremap/structuremap?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

StructureMap is available via NuGet:

```PowerShell
Install-Package StructureMap
```

Or alternatively via the .NET Core CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package structuremap
```


If you want to fix a bug or just want to tinker with an idea,
we love receiving pull requests!

Building the Source
-------------------

As of StructureMap 4.3, the codebase uses the new Dotnet CLI to build and run tests. Paket is no longer used
to resolve nuget dependencies.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git://github.com/structuremap/structuremap.git`
1. (Optional) From the command line, `dotnet test src/StructureMap.Testing`
1. Open the solution at src/StructureMap.sln and go to town! 

Note:

The StructureMap team uses Rake internally and on the [CI server](http://build.fubu-project.org/project.html?projectId=StructureMap3), but **Rake is no longer necessary in any way for developing with the StructureMap codebase**. 

Please post any questions or bugs to the
[StructureMap Users mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/structuremap-users).

The latest documentation is available at [http://structuremap.github.io](http://structuremap.github.io).

Thanks for trying StructureMap.


Documentation Authoring
-----------------------

StructureMap uses the [StorytellerDocGen](http://storyteller.github.io/documentation/docs/) tool to author and publish the documentation website. 

The documentation is just markdown files in the *documentation* folder under the root. Code samples can be pulled from anywhere within the StructureMap codebase.
The actual web content is published manually to the [structuremap.github.com repository](https://github.com/structuremap/structuremap.github.com).

To run the documentation website locally, from the command line at the root of the StructureMap repository, either:

1. `rake docs` - If you're comfortable with Rake
1. `dotnet restore && dotnet stdocs run` - do note that this will default to the version being 1.0, but the correct version will be applied when it's actually published
